						Unity Engine has a new feature called <b><a href="https://unity.com/ecs">ECS for Unity</a></b>. It enforces <b>Data-Oriented Programming (DOP)</b>
						through certain restrictions on the entity query-update loop, such as the <b>query-foreach syntax</b> shown in the actual code snippet below.<br /><br />

						My teammate and I set out to make a full-scoped game, but the ECS framework proved to be more challenging than initially thought, lacking a lot of features
						and providing no support for stable 2D physics.
						So, we decided to turn our project into a tech demo, with me doing the physics engine and my teammate doing finite-state-machine-based AI.
						To my surprise, there weren't that many great resources out there when it came to game physics. I've gotten help from <b><a href="https://allenchou.net/">Allen Chou</a></b>,
						<b>Kevin Yu</b>, <b><a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020603/Physics-for-Game-Programmers-Understanding">Erin Catto</a></b>, and DigiPen Professor
						<b>Erik Mohrmann</b>.

						<h3>Collision Detection</h3>
						<b>Separating Axis Theorem (SAT)</b> can be used to detect if one convex polygon is penetrating another convex polygon. SAT will generate
						a penetrating point, penetration normal and depth.<br /><br />
						
						We can make an optimization here called <b>Edge Collision</b>. This is when the two edges in contact are parallel and therefore the two contact
						points can simply be treated as one, halving the processing needs and making the simulation more stable.

						<h3>Collision Resolution</h3>
						Collisions can be resolved by solving them for impulse (yes, the one we learned in physics class).
						I won't go into the nitty gritty details of how that works, but if you'd like to know more,
						<a href="https://research.ncl.ac.uk/game/mastersdegree/gametechnologies/physicstutorials/5collisionresponse/Physics%20-%20Collision%20Response.pdf">this paper</a> goes
						into how the impulse-based approach works.

						<h3>Stability</h3>
						Stability becomes important when there are constant contact points that are under constant pressure, as small errors in impulse can quickly accumulate
						over a few frames and end in a catastrophe. I've looked into it and chose to implement <b>Sequential Impulses</b> and <b>Baumgarte Stabilization</b>.
						These methods will prevent objects from sinking into each other or getting lodged.

					<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
						<h3>Friction</h3>
						In addition, we should also be mindful of another type of impulse: <b>Tangential Impulse</b> exerted by friction. Sequential impulse and Baumgarte
						stabilization can make a tower stable, but a structure like a pyramid would also require precise tangential impulse to stay still.<br /><br />

						An overview of stability and friction can be found <a href="http://allenchou.net/2013/12/game-physics-resolution-contact-constraints/">here</a>.

						<h3>Conclusion</h3>
						In this article, I have showcased my implementation of a 2D physics engine that handles everything better than the built-in ECS physics engine.
						The only regret I have is that I didn't have time to implement optimizations such as (1) making the code compatible with the <b>Burst Compiler</b>'s 
						requirements for low-level optimization, and (2) implementing <b>Sort and Sweep</b> for the broad phase collision detection. But I didn't let that
						stop me from enjoying this nice little Newton's Cradle!
